# complex-I
A complex number library in pure rust.

---
## Overview:
This library provides an implementation of complex numbers in Rust, utilizing the type Complex<T>,
where T represents a floating-point number that implements the Float trait. The library offers various
mathematical operations commonly associated with complex numbers, such as squaring, cosine, sine,
natural logarithm, and logarithm functions.

Motivation:
The implementation is inspired by Daniel Shiffman's Pi Day video. 
This library serves as both an exercise in understanding complex
numbers and as a practical tool for performing complex arithmetic operations in Rust.
